When your data is a total mess with no clear pattern—thousands of rows of inconsistent dates, mismatched categories, and broken strings—standard formulas fail. For non-coders, writing VBA or Python scripts is a steep hill to climb.

## 🏢 The Solution: Zero-Rule Data Triage
In 2026, Mica introduces a way to handle "un-ruleable" tasks directly on your local machine. It doesn't just suggest a fix; it performs the labor.

## 🧠 Why Mica Beats the "Cloud-First" Giants

Most AI tools require cloud uploads, posing a risk to sensitive financial reports or client lists. Mica works **locally**, acting as a specialized agent that understands the physical reality of your file system.



### The Mica Cleaning Process:
1. **Structural Scanning:** It scans the raw data and creates a `Cleaned Data` sheet immediately—preserving your original file.
2. **Autonomous Mapping:** It identifies column titles and data types (Dates, Currency, Strings) without manual header mapping.
3. **Resilient Execution:** If data is too complex (e.g., mismatched date formats), it flags the issue and awaits specific instructions instead of crashing.

Whether you are in **Finance, Accounting, or Logistics**, Mica acts as the bridge between "Data Hell" and "Analysis Ready."
