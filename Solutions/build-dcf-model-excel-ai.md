# 🏦 Building a Pro DCF Model with AI: No More Spreadsheet Grinding

Building a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model usually takes 4-8 hours of focused "don't talk to me" time. You have to link three financial statements, calculate WACC, and ensure terminal value projections don't break. Mica turns this multi-hour grind into a single prompt.

## 🏗️ The Financial Modeling Workflow
Mica doesn't just "fill a template"; it acts as a digital analyst, architecting the entire model structure across multiple sheets and linking them with mathematically sound formulas.

### The Prompt:
> `"Hey Mica, whip up a detailed DCF model in my work folder. Include assumptions for growth and a sensitivity table."`

## 🧠 The Architecture of an AI-Built DCF

Unlike a "black box" AI, Mica follows industry-standard modeling best practices. Every calculation is observable and auditable.



### Core Components Mica Automates:
* **Dynamic Input Sheet:** Mica creates a dedicated "Assumptions" tab. Change your growth rate or WACC here, and the entire model—including the valuation—updates instantly.
* **Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF):** It maps the bridge from EBITDA to FCF, accounting for Taxes, CapEx, and Changes in Working Capital without formula errors.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:** Mica automatically generates data tables (e.g., WACC vs. Terminal Growth) to show a range of valuations, a task that manually requires complex Excel "Data Tables."
* **Visual Integrity:** It applies professional color coding (blue for inputs, black for formulas) to ensure your model meets institutional standards.

### 🛡️ Local Execution = Data Security
In finance, data is everything. Because Mica runs **locally**, your proprietary valuation assumptions and internal projections never leave your machine. You get the speed of AI with the security of an air-gapped environment.
