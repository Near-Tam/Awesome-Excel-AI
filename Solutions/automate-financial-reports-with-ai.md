Building financial reports from scratch is often a tedious cycle of copying data, double-checking sums, and praying cell references don't break. In 2026, Mica transforms this workflow into a simple conversation.

## 🏦 The Financial Automation Workflow
Mica doesn't just "generate text"—it acts as a junior accountant, controlling Excel locally to build structured, boardroom-ready statements.

### The Prompt:
> `"Hey, whip up a detailed financial report in the Documents/workdata folder for me, yeah? Make it pop with all the deets."`

## 🧠 What Happens Under the Hood?

When Mica "whips up" a report, it follows a three-step professional protocol:



1. **Logical Structure:** Mica understands the hierarchy of Balance Sheets and P&Ls. It automatically maps raw data into standardized accounting categories.
2. **Formula Integrity:** This is critical. Every subtotal and grand total created comes with **live Excel formulas**. If you update a value later, the entire report recalculates correctly.
3. **Visual Polish:** It performs "Spreadsheet Housekeeping"—resizing columns, bolding headers, and applying currency formatting so it’s ready for immediate presentation.

### 🛡️ Privacy First
Because Mica runs **locally**, your sensitive financial data—revenue, margins, and payroll—never leaves your `Documents\workdata` folder. You get the intelligence of a large language model with the security of an air-gapped tool.
