# 🌍 You don't need VLOOKUP anymore. You just need to ask.

In 2026, productivity shouldn't feel like a math test. Most users aren't Excel wizards, and tasks like mapping country names to ISO codes shouldn't require a 20-minute Google rabbit hole for a lookup table. 

## 🤖 Semantic Operation: Intent Over Syntax
I tested Mica's ability to handle a real-world data enrichment task using a single casual sentence. No tutorials, no "Index-Match" gymnastics.

### The Prompt:
> `"There's a countries file in Documents\workdata with a list of country names. Add their ISO country codes in the column on the right."`

## 📺 Watch: From File Path to Finished Data
See Mica navigate to a local directory, identify the correct file, and map the data to global ISO standards autonomously:

## 🧠 The Intelligence Behind the Action

What's happening here is **Semantic Operation**. Mica doesn't just suggest a formula; it becomes an agent that:
1. **Navigates Locally:** Finds the file in your specific folder path.
2. **Visual Inspection:** "Looks" at the data to understand the headers and content.
3. **External Knowledge Mapping:** Connects your local text (e.g., "France") to global standards (e.g., "FR / FRA") without needing a pre-existing lookup sheet.



The future of spreadsheets isn't about mastering complex formulas; it's about having an assistant that understands your **intent**. Mica treats your local software as a flexible workspace where natural language is the only syntax you'll ever need.
