# 🎨 "I’m fine with analysis, but formatting is soul-crushing." So I let AI do it.

Resizing columns, picking font weights, and aligning cells is a productivity killer with zero creative payoff. In 2026, we shouldn't be clicking "Bold" and "Center" 50 times a day. 

## 🏗️ The Experiment: Beautifying Market Analysis
I used Mica to handle a real-world mess: a half-finished market analysis file. The goal was professional formatting without me touching a single button.

### The Prompt:
> `"Please help me beautify the fonts and cell formatting in the Market_Analysis_Sample file in Documents\workdata. Do not modify my data or formulas — just focus on the formatting improvements."`

## 🧠 Why "Intent" Beats "Automation"
The magic isn't just speed—it's **logic**. Unlike a standard macro, Mica:
1. **Scans for Context:** It identifies where headers end and data begins.
2. **Preserves Logic:** It locks down cells containing formulas to ensure the "engine" of your sheet stays intact.
3. **Iterative Refinement:** If a section is missed, a simple follow-up like *"Apply the same style to the bottom section"* finishes the job.

We are moving away from "software we operate" to **"agents we collaborate with."** If you can describe what you want, you can consider it done.
