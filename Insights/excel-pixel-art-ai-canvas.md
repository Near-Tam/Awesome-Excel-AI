Today, we push Mica into territory it was definitely not built for. We usually talk about data cleaning and VLOOKUPs, but in 2026, productivity is also about creative mastery of your tools.

## 🚀 The Experiment
Can an AI understand the **spatial structure** of a spreadsheet, or is it just mimicking formulas? I gave Mica a blank sheet and an "unhinged" prompt.

### The Prompt:
`"Create a beach pixel art in Excel, using each cell as a pixel."`

## 🧠 The Scarily Smart Logic Behind the Art
What looks like a "silly" drawing actually reveals massive insights into how Mica views your workspace:

1. **Environment Manipulation:** Mica didn't just dump colors. It immediately **resized every single cell** into a perfect square, recognizing that the standard `8.43` column width wouldn't work for art.
2. **Component Planning:** It identified and mapped components: Sky, Sun, and Palm Trees.
3. **Hex Code Mapping:** It translated artistic intent into a series of hex codes and cell fills across a coordinated grid.

*Note: This file contains no macros, only cell background formatting (Hex colors) and custom grid scaling applied by the AI.*

## 💡 Key Takeaway for Professionals
If an AI can understand the **spatial logic** of a pixel beach, imagine how it views your complex financial models or inventory maps. 

AI isn't just "using" Excel; it's turning the software into a flexible, creative canvas. The "how" (resizing, formatting, mapping) is now the AI's job—your job is simply to define the "what".
