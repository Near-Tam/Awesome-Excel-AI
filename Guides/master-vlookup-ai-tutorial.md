Does AI make human skills obsolete? On the contrary—if you choose to learn, AI becomes the ultimate level-up tool. Instead of scrolling through documentation, you can now have Mica build a live classroom directly inside your spreadsheet.

## 🧪 The "Instant Classroom" Experiment
I asked Mica to teach me VLOOKUP from scratch. It didn't just give me a text definition; it prepared the data and the examples for me to interact with.

### The Prompt:
> `"Show me how to use VLOOKUP in Excel with a detailed example."`

## 🧠 What Makes This Workflow Better?

Mica isn't just a formula generator; it acts as a **Learning Partner**:

1. **Auto-Generated Context:** It creates a realistic `ProductData` sheet (A2:C100) so you have immediate data to query.
2. **Interactive Examples:** It sets up a `vlookup_example` sheet to show how the formula behaves in different scenarios.
3. **Syntax Breakdown:** It explains exactly what each parameter (lookup_value, table_array, col_index, range_lookup) does.

### The Logic Implemented:
`=VLOOKUP(F2, ProductData!$A$2:$C$100, 2, FALSE)`

Excel didn’t get harder; we just finally got a tutor that teaches inside the tool itself. When AI handles the setup, you can focus on mastering the logic.
