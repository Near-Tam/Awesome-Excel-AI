# 📈 Stop Wrestling with CSVs: Let AI Handle Your Moving Average Charts

> **Original Guide:** [Import CSV and Calculate MA10 in Excel using AI](https://mica.mindlink.tools/blog/guides/import-csv-calculate-ma10-excel-ai.html)
> **Category:** #Finance-Analysis #Excel-AI #Mica-Tutorial #Moving-Average

If you spend more than five minutes importing CSVs and dragging formula corners in Excel, you’re doing "digital manual labor." Whether it's broken date formats or slow recalculations, manual data entry is a relic of the past.

## 🤖 The Modern Financial Workflow
I replaced a 10-minute manual process with a single sentence. No clicking through "Data > From Text/CSV" menus—just pure automation.

### The Prompts Used:
1. `"Import EURmain-1min.csv from Documents\workdata to Excel."`
2. `"Calculate the 10-period Moving Average (MA10) for the price and create a chart."`
